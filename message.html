            <p>You were 15 when I was born and by the time I could
              form memories (around 3 years old) you were already a 
              grown man. Having to grow up without a dad who was 
              physically with us wasn’t always easy and was never 
              ideal. But consciously, and oftentimes unconsciously, I 
              looked to you as the leader to show the rest of us the 
              way through the void that was left behind. You did an 
              excellent job of setting the standard and your <strong>impact</strong> on 
              who I grew up to be can’t be measured.
